# Demonstration of CRUD Operations on a Customer Table with SQL Server

## Description:
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the four fundamental data manipulation operations known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete), applied to a customer table in a SQL Server database. The project uses DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands to perform these operations on the table records.

## Details of CRUD operations:

Create (Data insertion): The insertion operation will be demonstrated using the INSERT command, which is responsible for adding new records to the customer table, such as name, address, telephone number and other relevant data.

Read (Data reading): The reading operation will be implemented using the SELECT command, which will allow querying and displaying the data in the table, filtering information according to specific criteria, such as searching by name or city.

Update (Data update): The update operation will be demonstrated using the UPDATE command, where one or more fields of a specific record can be changed, such as updating a customer's address or phone number.

Delete (Data deletion): The delete operation will be performed using the DELETE command, to remove a specific record from the customer table, either by ID or other unique identifier.

## Technologies used:

SQL Server: The relational database used to store customer information.

DML (Data Manipulation Language): A set of SQL commands, such as INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE, for manipulating data in the table.

## Objective:
The project aims to teach and exemplify the basic functioning of CRUD operations in a relational database environment, using a customer table as a case study. Through it, it is expected that users understand how to insert, query, update, and delete records efficiently and practically.
